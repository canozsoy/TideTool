# TideTool
TideTool applies spectral analysis to the given time-series. It will illustrate tidal constituents from spectral analysis as graph and text. Using tidal constituents, it will state the type of the area. However, tidal constituents should be checked manually, from spectral analysis sometimes tidal constituents are shiftes. For example, in practice S2 is accepted as 12 hour tidal constituent, in spectral analysis it may corresponds to 11.7 hour or something like that, it is better to check from graph. 

TideTool is also applies time-series analysis through calculating daily maximums and daily minimums of tide. Thus, it will give properties like MHHW (Mean Higher High Water), MLHW (Mean Lower High Water), MHLW (Mean Higher Low Water), MLLW (Mean Lower Low Water) and MSL (Mean Sea Level). It will applies high and lower filters to time-series to calculate two different properties i) by eleminating long term signal, it will reduce MSL to 0 and it will calculate pure tide ii) by eleminating short term signal, it will calculate seasonal changes in the time-series (Note that at least a full year data should be provided to calculate seasonal changes). 

runTide.m is the executable script for the TideTool, it takes time-series of water level as input file (input.txt). Inputs field should be filled according to situation. Inputs are explained as comments in the script.
